# Errors

How the ComplyAdvantage Mesh API handles error responses

Our APIs utilize HTTP status codes for error management. In the event of a failed API call, we will return a 4xx or 5xx status code.

## Error codes

These are the status codes returned from all endpoints. Some endpoints may have additional errors which are detailed within the respective endpoint documentation.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 401    | **Unauthorized** - Please ensure your authentication token is correct |
| 403    | **Permissions error** - You do not have the correct permissions to access the resource |
| 404    | **Not found** - The requested resource could not be found |
| 409    | **Conflict** - The request conflicts with another request |
| 429    | **Too many requests** - Too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting). |
| 500    | **Internal server error** - The server has encountered an error. If this persists, please contact support. |

## Error structures

These are the typical error structures you will receive for each error code.

```json
{
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": "Invalid authentication for resource."
}
